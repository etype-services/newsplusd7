       <p>“The well-paced action features the usual men at play with fists and guns, but Burke also offers three strong women with pivotal roles, one of whom could be a match for any of the tough guys. Burke [has a] sure hand for crisp dialogue and a compelling story.” <span id="u54564-2">—Kirkus</span></p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p>“Two-time Edgar winner Burke sets Texas Ranger Hackberry Holland the task of protecting a precious artifact (is it the Holy Grail?) from a string of villains, including an Austrian arms dealer who sets his sights on Holland’s son Ishmael, who serves in the US Army; Burke does not disappoint.&quot; —<span id="u54564-6">Boston Globe</span></p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p>“Readers of best-selling Burke's novels about the Holland family (<span id="u54564-10">Wayfaring Stranger</span>) will gravitate to this prequel featuring the well-known and notoriously cantankerous Hackberry Holland. The large cast features complex and compelling characters, and the action deftly builds to a roaring boil.” —<span id="u54564-12">Library Journal</span></p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p>“Stunning . . . . Crisp dialogue highlights this tale of redemption and the bonds of family, and the breathtaking conclusion is one that readers won’t soon forget.” —<span id="u54564-16">Publishers Weekly</span> (starred)</p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p>“Burke wins us over yet again with another fusillade of lyrical, deeply moving prose that makes us feel the beating hearts of all his characters, demon-wracked though they may be.” —<span id="u54564-21">Booklist</span> (starred)</p>

      <p class="Review-Text" id="u54570-55">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u54570-57">I was a caseworker with migrant farm workers, the homeless, the criminally insane, parolees, and former felons. I was also a caseworker with people who were simply very poor. I learned a great deal about the arbitrary nature of both criminal and social justice. I discovered that slum property in Los Angeles is often owned by people with addresses in the Wilshire District or Beverly Hills. It was routine in our neighborhood to see black people arrested for drinking a beer in front of a convenience store or flipping coins on a street corner. A slum is not simply a place of impoverishment; it is also a place on enrichment. The hookers operated in full view on every street in our neighborhood. The gangs were the Gladiators, the Viscounts, the Purple Hearts, the Spiders, Clanton 14, and the Choppers. The issue was turf and drugs. Liquor stores and pawnshops did a booming business. This isn't an indictment. It's just the way things are.</p>

The first two books sold well and established you as a writer, but the third book didn’t fare as well. Throughout the early years of your career, publishing would alternatively embrace and then abandon you. How did you keep the faith in your talent? Did it send you back to the drawing board? How did you cope with these ups and downs?</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u54570-71">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u54570-73">During the middle of my career I went thirteen years with being able to publish a novel in hardback. It was a discouraging time, a bit like being rich twice and going broke three times. I had to go back to an old lesson: Write as best you can a day at a time; write to make the world a little better place if possible; never forget your talent was given to you for a reason; and never leave a manuscript unsubmitted for more than thirty-six hours.</p>

      <p class="Review-Text" id="u54570-79">By 1984, your books were out of print and you had not been able to attain a publishing deal for a hardcover book in thirteen years. Then you sent a collection of short stories to Louisiana State University Press to consider for publication. They published the stories the next year under the title <span class="TextTitle" id="u54570-77">The Convict.</span> What was that experience like?</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u54570-80">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u54570-82">Louisiana State University Press resurrected my career and I will never be able to repay the debt I owe them. The Press was founded by Robert Penn Warren and Cleanth Brooks, and has retained their high standards over the decades. They’re gentle and good and kind people who are a pleasure to work with, and every one of them has an accent that for a moment or two makes you wish the South had won the Civil War.</p>

      <p class="Review-Text" id="u54570-88">But even with the success of the LSU short story collection you still weren’t “out of the woods.” Your next manuscript gained the distinction of being the most rejected book in New York’s publishing history at the time — rejected 111 times over a nine-year period. <span class="TextTitle" id="u54570-86">The Lost Get-Back Boogie</span> (1986) was later nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. Was the Pulitzer nomination the turning point to secure your place in letters?</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u54570-89">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u54570-97">The publisher's nomination and the good reviews of <span class="TextTitle">The Lost Get-Back Boogie</span> gave me the credentials I needed to submit once again in New York. My next novel was <span class="TextTitle">The Neon Rain.</span> Three New York publishers bid on it. I almost fainted. My agent was (and is) Philip Spitzer. When we met through my cousin <span class="TextAuthor">Andre Dubus, Senior,</span> he was running a one-man agency during the day and driving a cab in Hell's Kitchen at night. When Philip had a bad day, he would jog on the northern rim of Central Park to bait the muggers out of the trees so he could he pound them into pulp. I said, this is the guy for me.</p>

      <p class="Review-Text" id="u54570-101">The City of New Iberia, Louisiana, has an entire section on its website devoted to you. Many of your fans make the pilgrimage to the city just to see Dave Robicheaux’s descriptions. What does it feel like to have created such an affinity for the place that’s home for you?</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u54570-102">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u54570-104">It's very kind and flattering.</p>

      <p class="Review-Text" id="u54570-110">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u54570-112">A good writer of dialog is a good listener. It's all around us. The great dramas are in the commonplace, not on the wide screen.</p>

      <p class="Review-Text" id="u54570-119">The family-owned houses have disappeared. Nonetheless, there are many great editors and publishers still around. I have been fortunate to work with some of the truly great ones. I've been with my current publisher almost twenty years. They have been extremely loyal to me and my work and my family. I learned many years ago that a book's success often depends on people who never receive thanks or credit for anything, and that includes publishers, copy and literary editors, cover artists, the production team, the local book reps, publicists, and finally the people in the bookstores and the librarians who carry a guy through hard times.</p>

      <p class="Review-Text" id="u54570-124">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u54570-126">Don't ever quit. Don't write for money or fame, either. If you do, you'll never have any. Talent is a flame; it's meant to bring light into the world. Your art takes you inside eternity; you take up residence with Homer and the people who wrote the Bible and the Greek tragedies and the plays performed on the stage of the Globe Theater. In short, you become a player. You let the score take care of itself. By the top of the ninth the math on the score board usually looks pretty good.</p>

      <p class="Review-Text" id="u54570-131">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u54570-133">I work all the time, night, noon, and morning, with no days off. To borrow a phrase, it's like chopping cotton; you do it from cain't-see to cain't-see and then some.</p>

      <p class="Review-Text" id="u54570-139">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u54570-144"><span class="TextTitle">House of the Rising Sun</span> and <span class="TextTitle">Wayfaring Stranger</span> are the best novels I've written. Nothing else I've done comes close to them. I feel blessed by both the world and the spiritual forces I believe are on the other side of the stars as well as in our midst. We live in a grand country. The sun comes up every morning. Every day can be an adventure. What greater playground could one have than the world of trees and sky and wind and roaring rivers, and all of it for free, right at the end of our fingertips?</p>
