      <p class="Review-Text" id="u39693-54"><span class="Leading-Sans-Serif-Caps">October 4, 2015, will mark the tenth year</span> that romance authors and readers have gathered for the Buns &amp; Roses Romance Tea for Literacy in Richardson, Texas, to benefit the Richardson Adult Literacy Center. Hats, laughter, and the joy of talking books abound.</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u39693-55">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="Review-Text" id="u39693-60">Katie Patterson, executive director of RALC, says, “For the Richardson Adult Literacy Center, Buns &amp; Roses is an incredible expression by romance writers and readers from across the country of their passion for helping others improve their literacy. Because of this event, RALC is able to continue offering English as a Second Language instruction to hundreds of adults in our community who are eager to improve their lives through improved literacy skills.”</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u39693-61">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u39693-67">This year, <span id="u39693-63">New York Times</span> bestselling author <span class="TextAuthor">Tessa Dare</span> will headline 26 romance authors who host tables and visit with fans, readers, and literacy supporters. Attendees purchase a ticket to sit with their favorite author. Each author adds her own flair by decorating her table with gifts for her guests. In addition, each attendee receives a complimentary copy of the keynote speaker’s book and an autograph keepsake booklet for gathering the authors’ autographs. Andrea Horvath, longtime romance reader, attends each year “because it’s a great way to meet new authors and support a wonderful charity.”</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u39693-68">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u39693-73">Authors hosting tables are <span class="TextAuthor">Tessa Dare, Katharine Ashe, D. D.

      <p class="Review-Text" id="u39693-76">Another longtime romance reader, Donna Finlay, enjoys “meeting favorite authors, getting my books signed and making new friends who understand my book obsession. But even if you’re not a reader, it is a fun event for a worthwhile charity. And you might find something wonderful in the auction items!” Two extremely popular auction mainstays are a week’s stay in a Scottish lodge and a lovingly created one-of-a-kind handmade quilt.</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u39693-77">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u39693-79">And then there are the wildly sought-after bears. Each year a limited number of plush bears are dressed in unique costuming. Past costumes include Robin Hood, a cowboy, and a bear in a kilt. Nestled inside white boxes, some of which contain an additional surprise, the bears are unveiled after the keynote address. Attendees frantically wave $20 to signal that they want one. Author Addison Fox who is hosting a table for the sixth time says, “My favorite part is the excitement that ripples through everyone when the bear boxes come out.”</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u39693-80">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u39693-82">The event closes with a book signing, providing attendees with a chance to visit with all the authors, purchase books, and get those books autographed.</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u39693-83">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u39693-88">The tea will be held Sun., Oct. 4, 3-6:00 pm at the Renaissance Hotel, Richardson, Texas. Tickets are $45.

      <p class="Review-Text" id="u39703-238">Moore is a man many Abilenians are familiar with as he has produced a number of award-winning works documenting Abilene's history such as the &quot;History in Plain Sight&quot; documentary film series. Born and raised in Abilene, Moore has been a teacher at Abilene High School since 1992, currently teaching U.S. History and serving as the Department Head for Social Studies. His passion for history is not only noticed by his students and the community, but outside of the community as well. Moore has received the 2011 National Award of Merit from the American Association of State and Local History, the 2011 Maxine Perini Award from the Taylor County Historical Commission, the 1996 Spotlight Teacher of the Year Award from the Abilene Independent School District, the 2013 Outstanding Teaching of the Humanities Award from Humanities Texas, and more. With his unique style of making history come to life, Moore will participate in the Authors in Schools program during the festival, reaching out to local students in the area and discussing his book, <span class="TextTitle">Abilene A to Z.</span></p>

      <p class="Review-Text" id="u39703-242"><span class="TextAuthor">Roger Moore,</span> Merkel, TX</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u39703-245">Moore is a noted cartoonist, with a cowboy bent, who has worked in many areas over the course of his life including raising cotton, working as a coach/teacher, joining Texas Instruments in Dallas, and eventually turning to advertising. He would soon start drawing editorial cartoons for the Allen American in Collin County, while also working as a lobbyist to represent the textbook industry. In 1974, Moore would work with the Austin Citizen, creating a weekly cartoon through the early '80s, later establishing the &quot;Bona Fide Original Real Texas Calendar.&quot; Moore creates his work with pen and ink, keeping his characters simplistic. Throughout his years, Moore has come to finally figure life out. He states, &quot;I've been divorced and have gone broke a couple times. But sooner or later, a man's got to figure out what's really important in life. To me, it's having a loving family like I have now and doing what you want to do, not what someone else wants you to do.&quot; Moore will be present at the festival on Fri., Sept., 25 and presenting on his book titled <span class="TextTitle">My Texas.</span></p>
