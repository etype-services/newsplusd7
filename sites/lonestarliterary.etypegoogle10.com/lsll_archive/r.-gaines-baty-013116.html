      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-36">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-39"><span class="Leading-Sans-Serif-Caps">GAINES BATY:</span> This story has brewed inside me for my entire life. Not that I ever dreamed of writing a book, but the story—the legend—was there. My mother told me stories about my dad for as long as I can remember. I’m sure this was her way of keeping him alive for me, and for herself, in the only way she could. As I grew older the stories began to mean more to me. I yearned to know more, and regret not asking more questions earlier. And I wanted my kids to know about this hero of mine.</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-40">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-46">Over time, a number of profound events rocked me—slapped me in the face— with who my dad was and what he stood for. These are detailed in the book. Then, the “final straw” came as I read the mention of my dad’s name in a popular book by <span class="TextAuthor">Jim Dent,</span> titled <span class="TextTitle">Twelve Mighty Orphans.</span> It occurred to me that my dad’s story was as good as or better than the story I was reading, and I made the decision to write the book. This was 2007. Trust me, I had no idea what I was committing myself to. But I had to do it—it was not a choice. I needed to learn more, I wanted to honor my dad, and I wanted for my kids to know the story— a family legacy.</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-47">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-51">I first assumed that I’d spend a few weekends talking with his friends and family and documenting the stories I heard. One thing led to another. And as I spoke to his old players in El Paso, I realized that this story was for a much greater audience than just my family. I’d always considered my dad my hero. However, I was moved by the realization that he was not just <span id="u63338-49">my</span> hero— in fact he was a “legend” to many people, at every step in his life. Further, his accomplishments and his teachings were relevant for a much more universal audience than just my family—and as important for our troubled world of today as they were sixty-five years ago. Early manuscript readers and my publisher agreed.</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-52">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-53">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-55">Had you ever written any long piece before? Did you consider using a ghost writer? What made you decide to write the book yourself?</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-56">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-58">This is my first book. I had no idea what I was committing myself to, and I quickly realized that I was in way over my head. I did consider and search for a co-writer, but the only person who would agree to take on the project quoted a price of $40,000 for his services. Of course, this seemed prohibitive at the time, but upon reflection after my eight years of long nights and weekends—it might have proven to be cheaper in the end.</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-59">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-61">Seriously, though, several wise people advised that this was a book that I should write. To coach myself up for the task, I read several “how to” books… “how to write non-fiction” and “how to tell a story,” and had the help of a couple of good editors. In the end, I just tried to keep it simple—to stay out of way with my writing and let the story tell itself.</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-62">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-64">It was a very interesting process, learning of my family’s history and about that fascinating era. It was also very emotional, and inspiring. Sometimes I would literally cheer out loud at the keyboard. Sometimes I would cry. In the end, I am inspired and humbled by my dad.</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-65">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-66">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-68">For our readers who haven’t read the book, how would you describe it for them?</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-69">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-81">It’s a story about an <span id="u63338-71">ordinary</span> boy who grew up during the depression in an <span id="u63338-73">ordinary</span> small Texas town, went to college, then took an <span id="u63338-75">ordinary</span> job. What makes it so compelling is that all along the way, he did such <span id="u63338-77">extraordinary</span> things. In the end, he transformed the lives and culture of an entire generation of young Hispanic men, their families, and their descendants. This man is a legend in this community. Of course it looks like sports book, but it’s much more than just inspiring sports story. At its core, <span id="u63338-79">Champion of the Barrio</span> is a powerful story about character, heart, and&nbsp; leadership.</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-82">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-84">Let’s back up a few years to set the stage. This “boy” was a great athlete, a WWII veteran, and after the war he quarterbacked the Texas Aggies against the likes of Doak Walker, Tom Landry, Darrell Royal, Bobby Layne, etc., and was drafted to play pro ball. But he chose instead to pursue his calling—coaching high school football and building men. He ended up in El Paso, as head coach of Bowie High School in the Segundo Barrio (the ghetto) on the south side of town—a stone’s throw from the Mexican border. These kids were downtrodden, the poorest of the poor, with no aspirations, and no hope. He helped them rise above hardship and discrimination to become winners on and off the field, successful men and leaders. They recognized this influence over time, and honored their old coach in an incredible fashion.</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-85">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-87">This boy, athlete, coach, and legend was my father. Tragically, he died when I was young. Through the writing of this story, I got to meet him.</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-88">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-89">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-91">What a wonderfully inspiring book—especially for young men coming of age. Do you do any outreach with schools regarding the book and the stories found within it?</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-92">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-94">Great question. It was written with young men and women in mind. And we want to get the story out to kids who might benefit from it. To date, the following have happened or are happening in this direction:</p>
      <ul class="list0 nls-None" id="u63338-109">
       <li class="Review-Text" id="u63338-96">Several high schools and one college that we know of are considering the book for a reading option and/or curriculum inclusion</li>
       <li class="Review-Text" id="u63338-98">One man is using the book as a guideline in helping troubled kids in Albuquerque, NM. He says that these boys have ankle bracelets in lieu of incarceration due to drug and/or gang activity, and that some of the Champion principles and leadership approaches are very helpful in his efforts. He wants to help these boys earn the right to remove their ankle bracelets.</li>
       <li class="Review-Text" id="u63338-100">The book is required reading for consideration for two scholarship awards. The best essays on the book win partial college scholarships.</li>
       <li class="Review-Text" id="u63338-102">276 books were handed out to Christian Coaches Retreat participants this summer to serve as inspiration on how to reach and influence kids in a positive and constructive manner.</li>
       <li class="Review-Text" id="u63338-104">75 books were given to a group of high school student athletes from across Texas, and a $1,000 scholarship was awarded to a very deserving boy from Wichita Falls.</li>
       <li class="Review-Text" id="u63338-106">We hope to place the book in as many high school and college libraries as possible. This will require funding to provide the books.</li>
       <li class="Review-Text" id="u63338-108">A university professor/dean suggested that this was a “very important piece of work,” and that he intended to structure discussions for his Hispanic Studies classes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-110">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-112">We want to do more. Any help or suggestions from your readership will be appreciated.</p>

      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-116">A portion of the proceeds from the book goes to the Buryl Baty Scholarship Fund. Can you tell us more about that?</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-117">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-120">Yes, a significant portion of the proceeds will go toward a scholarship for one or more deserving senior students at Bowie High School in El Paso. It will be awarded based upon a number of selection criteria, including an essay on what they learned and their experience of reading <span id="u63338-119">Champion of the Barrio.</span></p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-121">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-123">In fact, it is noted in the book that contributions can be made in any amount to: Bowie Alumni Association, Scholarship Fund (Buryl Baty Memorial Scholarship), P. O. Box 1804, El Paso, TX 79949. A couple of really good kids would appreciate your help.</p>

      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-127">It has struck me that as an executive recruiter, you may have had a lot in common with your father. That is, finding the right players with the right character for the right position. You’ve probably heard that before. What other ways have you felt or heard that you were similar to your father even though you lost him when you were a child?</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-128">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-132">Any comparison to my dad is considered a compliment by me. I have been told that I look like him, I sound like him, that our demeanors are similar. His kids (former players—now eighty-plus years old) call me “Coach.” And some call me “Hermano,” claiming that I am one of their family. Our jersey numbers (#84) were the same—purely by coincidence? And I love to coach…I coach daily in my business. One other connection comes to mind… as I wrote the book, I felt that I was almost channeling his spirit on its pages. It seemed that, as <span class="TextAuthor">Harriet Beecher Stowe</span> said, “I just held the pencil.”</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-133">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-134">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-136">Like your father, you played college football. He played at Texas A&amp;M, and you played at Texas Tech. How did playing college football shape your coming of age?</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-137">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-139">Football was in my blood, and I always hoped/knew that I’d play college ball. I’m sure this was inspired by my father’s legacy, and made possible by a few of his genes. The actual realization of this dream constituted, for me, closure of a lifelong goal and the most exciting thing I’d ever done. Subconsciously, it probably was my way of measuring up to my dad’s standards. The experience, and a few great coaches along the way, undoubtedly ingrained in me the principles that have contributed to any successes I have attained: confidence, work ethic, preparation, tenacity, rising to challenges, teamwork, pursuit of excellence, etc. It was very moving and personal for me when the accounts of so many of my dad’s speeches and comments echoed these same tenets.</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-140">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-141">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-143">One of the things that I haven’t been able to find is this piece of information from your biography. Are you a father, and if so, how has your father’s story inspired you to become a better father?</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-144">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-146">I have three great adult children. As I researched and learned of my dad’s teachings, I frequently thought to myself that “I wish someone had told me that when I was young,” and “I wish I’d told my kids that when they were young,” and “I hope they tell their kids that.” Partially because of these realizations, the book was written with young people in mind. I insisted that my kids read it. They loved it, and thanked me for writing it.</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-147">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u63338-149">To answer your question, yes it has helped me and hopefully many others to be better fathers/parents, teachers and mentors. I feel that this process has in many ways made me a better person. Hopefully, the book serves the purpose of carrying on his work.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“It's fun learning about Coach Baty. He could run. He could pass. He was a great leader on and off the field. It's a great story about a great man.&quot; —Roger Staubach, executive chairman of Jones, Lang, LaSalle; Heisman Trophy winner; Super Bowl champion; and Hall of Fame quarterback</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“Perhaps the most talented and gifted athlete to ever come out of Paris High School . . . a coach would consider himself mightily blessed to get one Buryl Baty during his coaching career.” —Raymond Berry, NFL Hall of Fame player and Super Bowl coach, NFL All-Time Team, and Retired Number 82 for the Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“You could not grow up in Paris, Texas, without knowing about Buryl Baty. I’ve heard about him all my life, and now I know why. He took on the world, and he won. This is an inspiring account and a great read.” —Gene Stallings, former head coach at Texas A&amp;M University, St. Louis Cardinals, and the National Championship University of Alabama; and College Football Hall of Fame</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“A great story about a man who touched lives and is still touching them even though he is gone . . . This book is a good read about character and football.” —Kent Hance, former Chancellor of the Texas Tech University System, U.S. Congressman, Chairman of the Texas Railroad Commission, and Texas State Senator</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“I knew Buryl Baty well. He created a glorious era and legacy for his team and school, and it was unbelievable how he captured El Paso’s heart. This is a gripping story -- that brought tears to my eyes. Buryl Baty's name lives on.” —Ray Sanchez, former writer and editor of the El Paso Herald-Post, author of seven books, member of five Halls of Fame, recipient of several journalism awards, and consultant for the movie <span id="u63345-18">Glory Road</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“The author describes his father as a hero and a legend, and by the end of the story the case is made. Buryl Baty was an athlete and a coach, but he is a legend because he inspired young Latinos to reach for a better life. The young people of El Paso’s Segundo Barrio faced prejudice every day . . . many readers will be shocked at the vicious treatment Coach Baty’s young players received in Snyder and Big Spring. Discrimination against Latinos is not as familiar to most Americans as discrimination against African Americans. Coach Baty’s fight against racism and bigotry should resonate with readers.” —Michael Barr, author, <span id="u63345-22">Remembering Bulldog Turner, Unsung Monster of the Midway</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&quot;I believe in this story and in the power of one person to change the lives of the young people entrusted to his care—in this case a football team who Coach Baty would not allow to be discriminated against. It is powerful and uplifting.” —Frances B. Vick, coauthor of <span id="u63345-26">Petra’s Legacy</span> and <span id="u63345-28">Letters to Alice</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“The spirit of Buryl Baty lives on so strongly in our hearts and minds because this man was a hero to us all. Coach Baty was a god-send, touching so many lives. He left us too soon, but he left his legacy of inspiration, social consciousness, and love. This book is a must read!” —Nolan Richardson Jr., Hall of Fame, NCAA National Championship Coach, and graduate of Bowie High School in the Segundo Barrio of El Paso</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“Perhaps one of Buryl Baty's most important legacies is the hard lessons he taught a generation of Mexican Americans who overcame so many strikes against them. El Paso owes Gaines Baty a ton of gratitude for reconnecting us with a man whose story continues to inspire.” —<span id="u63345-35">El Paso Times</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“Champion of the Barrio is more than a biography; it is also the firsthand memories of author R. Gaines Baty, Buryl Baty’s son, and the testimonies of nearly one hundred individuals who knew Baty during his life. Highly recommended.” —<span id="u63345-39">Midwest Book Review</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“. . . part gentle pleasure in the sweet details from the diary of Coach Baty’s wife when she was a teenager, stories of the high-schooler Baty when they built campfires in locker rooms to keep warm, and traveled to away games wearing coats and ties. The author’s depictions of the football games are exciting and suspenseful, and it’s fun to read about names such as Bear Bryant, Tom Landry, and Frank Broyles before fame and fortune.” —<span id="u63345-43">Lone Star Literary Life</span></p>
