Taylor</span> kicked off the festivities with her book club discussion of <span class="TextTitle">The Book Thief</span> (Knopf Books for Young Readers, 2006) by <span class="TextAuthor">Markus Zusak</span>. When Mayor Taylor was voted into office in 2014, one of her first phone calls was to the director of the San Antonio Public Library. She wanted to promote reading and community engagement with a book club, believing that literacy is “foundational” for a community. According to Mayor Taylor, not only does improved literacy have positive effects on education levels, economic development, and prosperity, it enriches a community through shared culture and history. Students from Rhodes Middle School had the opportunity to ask Mayor Taylor questions about the book. She told the students that she grew up in a home in which the only book was the Bible; her favorite books are Gone with the Wind, Native Son, and Pride and Prejudice; and that she loves the book club because she gets to read as part of her job.</p>

      <p class="Review-Text" id="u111299-347">Beekman 1802 is a TV Show, mercantile, bestselling cookbook and memoir, website and tourism destination all inspired by the Beekman 1802 Farm in Sharon Springs, New York.</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u111299-348">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u111299-350">When Josh Kilmer-Purcell (advertising executive and NY Times Bestselling author of I Am Not Myself These Days and The Bucolic Plague) and his partner Brent Ridge (physician and former vice president of healthy living for Martha Stewart Omnimedia) purchased the historic Beekman 1802 Farm in 2007, they had no idea that it would launch one of the “fastest growing lifestyle brands in the country.”</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u111299-351">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u111299-353">Originally just a weekend getaway from their hectic NYC lives, the farm became their lifeline after both men lost their jobs within one month of each other during the recession of 2008. Faced with possible foreclosure, the pair made a decision — if they were going to save their farm, they would have to make it profitable.</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u111299-354">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u111299-356">After taking in a neighboring farmer and his herd of beloved dairy goats, Ridge and Kilmer-Purcell began producing soaps and cheese. As other neighbors taught them how to farm, Ridge and Kilmer-Purcell shared their city-honed skills — starting a website and mercantile. The men began working with several other local farmers and artisans to market their goods, and the entire village came together to host seasonal festivals, which are now attended by thousands of visitors from around the globe.</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u111299-357">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u111299-359">Soon the press began noticing this little farm and village that refused to give up. (New York Times, Daily News, USA Today) A television network launched a reality show about their effort — The Fabulous Beekman Boys (now airing on Cooking Channel) — which spread the Beekman message of hard work, living seasonally, and neighborly sharing around the globe.</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u111299-361">In 2012, the duo competed and won the grand prize in CBS’s The Amazing Race. More than 10 illion viewers watched for twelve weeks as Josh and Brent beat twenty other competitors in a 45,000-mile race around the world through twelve cities in nine different countries.</p>
