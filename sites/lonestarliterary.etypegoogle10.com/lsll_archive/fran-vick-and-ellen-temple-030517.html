We’ve been friends and colleagues ever since.&nbsp; When we found ourselves together in Lufkin, we worked on our masters’ at SFASU at the same time! Books and writing continued to be our shared passion. Our first collaboration in publishing was the publication of a series of five middle-school readers by <span class="TextAuthor">Judy Alter</span> that we called the Maggie Books. We worked together to start the Texas Book Publishers Association in the early ’80s, also.</p><p class="Review-Text" id="u220198-19">&nbsp;</p><p class="Review-Text" id="u220198-20">&nbsp;</p><p class="Review-Text" id="u220198-22">You discovered a niche in regional publishing in the mid-1980s to mid-’90s.

I opened up shop in my closet at our home in Diboll and published my first children’s book, <span class="TextTitle">Pauline and the Peacock</span> by <span class="TextAuthor">Doris Daniel</span>. And thinking I was another <span class="TextAuthor">Alfred Knopf,</span> I named my company Ellen C. Temple Publishing, Inc.! Becoming a publisher just seemed like a natural progression for me, and the Rice Publishing Course offered me a path to do it; it was either that or open a bookstore.

Before publishing I was an English teacher. I began publishing by publishing the Texas Folklore Society Publications. The first book I published was <span id="u220198-40">Built in Texas</span> in 1979. That was followed by <span class="TextTitle">Legendary Ladies of Texas,</span> co-published by the TFS and Texas Foundation for Women's Resources, Women in Texas History Project, with <span class="TextAuthor">Mary Beth Rogers</span> at the helm.</p><p class="Review-Text" id="u220198-47">&nbsp;</p><p class="Review-Text" id="u220198-65">That was my first work with that group, and it led to me distributing their other publications, such as <span class="TextTitle">Texas Women: A Celebration of History</span> by <span class="TextAuthor">Mary Beth Rogers,</span> <span class="TextAuthor">Ruthe Weingarten,</span> and <span class="TextAuthor">Sherry Smith.</span> I also distributed <span class="TextTitle">We Can Fly: Stories of Kathryn Stinson and other Gutsy Texas Women</span> by <span class="TextAuthor">Mary Beth Rogers,</span> <span class="TextAuthor">Sherry Smith,</span> and <span class="TextAuthor">Janelle Scott</span>—which Ellen brought out under the Ellen C.

It is no longer in existence because the many presses that started the association are no longer in business. <span id="u220198-131">Cinco Puntos Press</span> in El Paso is one of the few of that era still going very strong. However, the university presses in Texas have taken up the slack of publishing Texas writers and Texas topics left by the demise of the small presses of yore. Texas A&amp;M University Press has put together a consortium of university presses that market all of the books together in the consortium. I would not have been able to start UNT Press without the distribution that the <span id="u220198-133">Texas A&amp;M Press Consortium</span> offered. I think distribution may have been one of the major problems with the small presses when I first started publishing. It is almost impossible to get around to all the bookstores in the state at the time, then and now, by one small press. The Texas A&amp;M Press Consortium offers that and they also present all the books in the catalog to the corporate offices of Barnes &amp; Noble, Borders Buc-cee’s, for example. They have national and international book reps covering North America, including entrees to Costco, Sams, and shops/stores covered by umbrella companies—gift stores, tourist attractions, etc. They cover the wholesale distributors such as Ingram and Baker &amp; Taylor.</p><p class="Review-Text" id="u220198-136">&nbsp;</p><p class="Review-Text" id="u220198-138">Also, one of the big changes would have to be e-books. That has opened up a whole new area of publishing and placement for books.</p><p class="Review-Text" id="u220198-139">&nbsp;</p><p class="Review-Text" id="u220198-140">&nbsp;</p><p class="Review-Text" id="u220198-142">What books did you each read growing up?

I started very young with a group of books I think called <span class="TextTitle">Land of Enchantment, </span>that perhaps came with the Books of Knowledge. At least they were all kept together in one place. I can’t be sure of the names of those sets, however, and I have no one left to ask. Anyway, I loved them.</p><p class="Review-Text" id="u220198-149">&nbsp;</p><p class="Review-Text" id="u220198-151">I read early because I would not stay home with the babysitter while my mother went to teach, and ran away enough times that my mother decided I had better go to school her. I was three—not old enough to be wandering around Groveton. Mother was teaching an elementary class at Pennington. I don’t know the exact grade. I could stay if I sat in the back of the room and kept my mouth shut! So I began learning by osmosis as she taught, I suppose. I do not remember not being able to read. Plus everyone in the family was reading all the time, so I would be left out if I didn’t read!</p><p class="Review-Text" id="u220198-152">&nbsp;</p><p class="Review-Text" id="u220198-156">One of the “fairy tales” I read and loved because of the wonderful pictures accompanying it, did not have a name, or not one that I knew at the time or could understand. When I was a senior in high school, however, I discovered while reading one of our assignments that the story I had read when I was very, very young was a child’s version of <span class="TextTitle">Beowulf.</span> I told my teacher, “I know this story. I know how it ends.” He asked me to tell him about it and I did and finally remembered when I had first read the story. You would think that would warp my young mind, right? Maybe it did, but I loved those scary drawings and the story.</p><p class="Review-Text" id="u220198-157">&nbsp;</p><p class="Review-Text" id="u220198-159">Yes, I came from a family of marvelous storytellers—both of my parents were incredible teachers and parents. My father filled me full of family stories. I spent a lot of time in his lap when I was very young, begging him to tell me another story. My mother was the most colorful and imaginative person in my world, and in a lot of other people’s worlds, too. She made up words for things, for example. And would do such things as put out a saucer of milk on the back step in the evening and say, “If you want your flowers to be gay and bright, feed the fairies by the bright moonlight.” I know now she was probably feeding stray cats, but the fairies were very real to me. Need I say she was Irish?</p><p class="Review-Text" id="u220198-160">&nbsp;</p><p class="Review-Text" id="u220198-163"><span class="Leading-Sans-Serif-Caps">ELLEN: </span> My mother was a librarian, a pioneer in the field, and she directed my reading.&nbsp; I read everything! All the time! When she urged me to apply for a summer job with the local library in Lufkin, and I worked there for seven summers, my fate was sealed. I went on to major in English and history at the University of Texas at Austin. My favorite possession in those years was a stack permit for the main library in the Tower! I love to write, to read, to publish, and I love the people who do it, and also the people who sell books and who serve as librarians.</p><p class="Review-Text" id="u220198-164">&nbsp;</p><p class="Review-Text" id="u220198-165">&nbsp;</p><p class="Review-Text" id="u220198-167">During Women’s History Month, it’s only fitting that we talk about Houston in 1977 and the women’s marches earlier this year. Many books and talks will commemorate the National Women’s Conference in Houston in 1977. But maybe you could tell our readers—many of a generation too young to remember this event—what happened in 1977, and why it is so important to uncover and tell the stories of women’s history.</p><p class="Review-Text" id="u220198-168">&nbsp;</p><p class="Review-Text" id="u220198-177"><span class="Leading-Sans-Serif-Caps">ELLEN:</span>&nbsp; Here’s my story of the National Women’s History Conference, 1977. I started writing a history column for my small-town <span id="u220198-171">Diboll Free Press</span> in 1974. For eight years, our family traveled back and forth between Diboll and Austin, so I had the opportunity to do research in both places. I was lucky enough to discover an essay by <span class="TextAuthor">A. Elizabeth Taylor</span> entitled “The Woman Suffrage Movement in Texas” (<span id="u220198-175">Journal of Southern History</span> 27:2, May 1951, 194–215). I was a history major without any knowledge of the one-hundred-year struggle for the vote other than Susan B. Anthony’s lead role.</p><p class="Review-Text" id="u220198-178">&nbsp;</p><p class="Review-Text" id="u220198-182">So for my first history column for the <span id="u220198-180">Free Press,</span> armed with Dr. Taylor’s essay, I wrote the “History of the Woman Suffrage Movement in Angelina County.” I wanted to know the local story—especially how our local representatives had voted (no). The editor gave me a full page! And I went on to write about Fannie Farrington, who brought “civilization” to the rough-and-tumble sawmill town of Diboll; about Cora Nash, who cooked for the workers at the boardinghouses; about the Rev. Emma Irick, who was the minister for the Church of the Nazarene in Lufkin, and many others.</p><p class="Review-Text" id="u220198-183">&nbsp;</p><p class="Review-Text" id="u220198-189">Two events gave my collection of history articles a name. I attended the state run-up conference in Austin in preparation for the National Women’s Conference to convene in Houston in 1977.
