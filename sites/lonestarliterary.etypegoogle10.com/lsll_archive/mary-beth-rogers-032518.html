      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-12"><span class="Leading-Sans-Serif-Caps">In 1982 the Texas Democratic Party swept the entire slate of statewide elections,</span> <span id="u364846-9">choosing a little-known Travis County commissioner as state treasurer. In one of her first acts in that office, Ann Richards hired Houston native </span><span id="u364846-10">Mary Beth Rogers</span><span id="u364846-11"> of Dallas as deputy treasurer, and the two created a department that was a model of efficiency for the entire country. Eight years later Rogers served as Richards’ campaign manager — the last time a Democrat won state office. Rogers has spent a lifetime in public service and writing about public servants and trailblazers. Next week she will be inducted in the Texas Institute of Letters, and we caught up with her fittingly in the month of March — primary season — to get her take on Texas politics, writing, and life in the times of Trump.</span></p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-13">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-14">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-16">Where did you grow up, Mary Beth? Was your family political, or involved in public service? And how did you meet Ann Richards, future governor of Texas?</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-17">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-23">My family was always interested in politics, but never engaged in any kind of official activities. Political discussions were part of our lives, and my mother volunteered in campaigns for progressive Democratic candidates in Dallas. I actually met <span class="TextAuthor">Ann Richards</span> through my mother’s involvement with a group of women who studied and took action about issues they believed to be important. At the time, Ann was living in Dallas, and my husband and I were living in San Antonio, where I became actively involved in local politics. I had the opportunity to work in political causes and develop the kinds of skills that are required to manage successful political campaigns. It was also during this time that I began writing articles for the <span id="u364846-21">Texas Observer</span> and other publications.</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-24">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-26">By the time my husband and I, along with our two children, moved to Austin in 1970, Ann and her husband David Richards had lived there about a year. One day I got a call from Ann, who said, “Your mama wanted me to call you and welcome you to Austin.” She invited us to a party at her home, and we soon became friends. We were both active in various campaigns and were involved in organizations that promoted opportunities and advancement for women. When Ann ran for Travis County commissioner, I helped in her campaign. In 1982, Ann was elected state treasurer and she asked me to become the deputy treasurer.</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-27">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-28">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-30">What was it like to be the campaign manager for the first woman to win the governorship of Texas in more than fifty years?</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-31">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-33">When Richards ran for governor in 1990, she “drafted” me to run her campaign. It was a demanding, extremely hard-fought campaign against incredible odds. We managed to develop a strategy and put together the resources and volunteers necessary to win. We also managed to have a lot of good luck along the way, which always helps in a hard-fought campaign. After Ann’s victory, she asked me to become her chief of staff, a position I held for eighteen months before I started teaching at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at UT Austin.</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-34">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-35">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-41">Recently you published a new book, <span id="u364846-37">Turning Texas Blue: What It Will Take to Break the GOP Grip on America's Reddest State </span><span id="u364846-38">(St. Martin’s, 2016).</span><span id="u364846-39"> </span>Can you describe this book (and your earlier ones) for our readers?</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-42">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-44">Four years ago, pundits were proclaiming Wendy Davis to be the next Ann Richards. Richards had skyrocketed onto the national stage with the convention speech. Davis had skyrocketed onto the national stage with the filibuster, but she lost to Greg Abbott by 20 points. What was the difference between those two campaigns? Is Texas bluer in 2018 than it was in 2016? Why or why not?</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-45">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-51">My experiences in politics and government naturally informed several of the books I have written. <span class="TextTitle">Cold Anger, A Story of Faith and Power Politics,</span> was about Ernesto Cortes, who is one of the nation’s masters of community-based organizing. <span class="TextTitle">Barbara Jordan, An American Hero</span> was, of course, about the amazing leader who was such a moral force in American life.</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-52">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-56">When I wrote <span id="u364846-54">Turning Texas Blue</span> in 2016, it was my attempt to tell the story of how Texas had drifted away from the progressive policies of Ann Richards to become one of the most conservative states in the nation. While many compared candidate Wendy Davis, who ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2014, with Ann Richards, they ran at totally different times in the history of our state and nation. By the time Davis ran, Texas had developed into such a hard-right Republican state, it was virtually impossible for a candidate like her to have won.</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-57">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-58">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-60">What do you think happened in the 2016 U.S. presidential election? Why do you think Hillary Clinton lost?</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-61">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-63">First, I was simply blown away by the women’s marches all over the world after Trump’s inauguration. I was totally surprised by the size and passion exhibited. It was a culmination of the horror among women about the outcome of the 2016 election of a man who seemed to delight in demeaning and disrespecting women. I guess my surprise was that so many women, particularly young women, felt the same as I did. It was an amazing time of solidarity and a harbinger of things to come. We have been seeing a massive move away from Trump among college educated women since then and this may help provoke a Democratic wave election in the midterm elections next November.</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-64">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-66">Secondly, so many clues, which now seem obvious, were missed by Democrats during the course of the 2016 election. The Clinton folks seemed tone-deaf to the surge of resentment and racism that were rising from working-class folks who felt shut out of the nation’s prosperity. However, I don’t think there is any single factor that contributed to Clinton’s loss. Rather it was a combination of many things — the Comey letter, the Clinton campaign failing to heed warnings of disaster from in three key states, the Russian interference and email thefts on WikiLeaks, etc.</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-67">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-69">Also, cable news ran Trump’s entertaining campaign rallies nonstop, helping him spread his message without having to spend a dime. In short, the whole campaign was a nightmare — at least for me. There are so many lessons to be learned from the 2016 election, and I think that even now we are merely scratching the surface of the underlying causes of Trump’s victory. It seems like more revelations come out every day. I’m just hoping we know more by the time we get to the 2020 presidential election. Our democracy is at stake.</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-70">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-71">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-73">What do you think of the women’s marches, #metoo, the kids’ marches? Do you correlate this new wave of activism to a lack of political correctness with Trump, or is it something else?</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-74">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364846-76">I’m actually more hopeful about the future of Texas now than I have been in a long time. I think the “me too” movement, plus the activism of a new generation of fearless high school students in the aftermath of the Parkland shootings is causing voters to pause and take a hard look at some of the senseless policies that are destructive to humane endeavors. I think we will begin to focus on practices and politics that will allow all people — not just the privileged few — to rise and reach their potential. I don’t know if we will see a female president or not in the near future. But I do feel that after our experience with the current administration in Washington, we will more carefully assess the talent, temperament, competency, character, and compassion of those who seek the presidency in the future. Female or male, I believe our future leaders will bring a different, more inclusive perspective to public office. At least, that is my hope.</p>

      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364850-3">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364850-8">“Rogers...offers suggestions to Democrats in her new book, <span id="u364850-5">Turning Texas Blue..</span>.which include finding the right leader, running a whole-state campaign, and spreading the word about what she calls ‘Republican extremism.’” —<span id="u364850-7">San Angelo Standard-Times</span></p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364850-9">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364850-14">“It’s not easy being blue. It is easy, though, to find Democratic lamentations in Texas politics...Mary Beth Rogers is done with all that...Rogers lists 10 things Democrats might do to turn things around, including this one: ‘Assume the role of a Republican strategist.’” ― <span id="u364850-11">Texas Tribune</span><br/><br/></p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364850-21">“Rogers has a message for Democrats in <span id="u364850-16">Turning Texas Blue: </span>Get smart...what she offers bears attention, whether you’re a Democratic or a Republican strategist.” ―<span id="u364850-18">Austin American Statesman</span><br/><br/></p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364850-27">“Compelling...Rogers provides a useful road map for how Democrats can help beleaguered Texans reclaim their state from the far right and usher in a politics that can fulfill the untapped potential of the state’s cultural and economic diversity.” ―<span id="u364850-23">Washington Monthly's </span>Political Animal blog<br/><br/></p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364850-32">“A blueprint for turning Texas blue, or at least giving Democrats a fighting chance.” <span id="u364850-29">―Texas Observer</span><br/><br/></p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364850-36">“Rogers takes a clear-eyed look at the mistakes of the Davis campaign and...the painful lessons that Democrats need to learn if they really want to win in Texas.” ―Texas Matters<br/><br/></p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364850-41">“Everyone who seriously wants Texas to become a two party state needs to stop whining and read this book.” ―Paul Stekler, director of Emmy Award–winning documentary <span id="u364850-38">George Wallace: Settin' the Woods on Fire</span><br/><br/></p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364850-47">“There is a certain kind of Texas woman: strong, caring, steady and fun-loving. Mary Beth Rogers is such a ‘can-do’ person and in reading her book,<span id="u364850-43">Turning Texas Blue,</span> you will understand the best and worst of Texas politics. You will also learn Texas history and laugh out loud at many of her stories. When you finish you will know that you have been in the presence of an astute political observer, a loyal Democrat and a true patriot.” ―Bill Bradley<br/><br/></p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364850-52">“Will appeal to political junkies on both the left and right. Rogers a veteran political operative and confidante of the late Democratic governor Ann Richards, swiftly and entertainingly recounts Texas political history...She’s a clever, concise writer, unafraid to share her own experience of triumph and disappointment as Richards’s career waned, and brisk and scornful as she indicts ‘clowns, crackpots, and Christian crusaders’ on the Texas right for choosing small-government ideology over effective governance.” <span id="u364850-49">―Publishers Weekly</span><br/><br/></p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364850-56">“Rogers draws off the wisdom of a lifetime in Texas politics to write a timely lesson about how in the world we got to this place. Pulling no punches, this is a must-read for anyone doing the hard work to restoring state government that represents all Texans.” ―Cecile Richards, President, Planned Parenthood Action Fund<br/><br/></p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u364850-59">“Rogers provides genuinely sharp insight into where the Democrats went wrong [in Texas]...Readers ... who want change should pay attention and get started on the author's to-do lists. She knows the territory, and she wants it back.” <span id="u364850-58">―Kirkus Reviews</span></p>
