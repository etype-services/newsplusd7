She would say: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Bear. I‚Äôm a Dog. I‚Äôm a Cat,‚Äù etc. And then she would pretend she was the animal in question. I didn‚Äôt think she was very good. I knew I could do better. Also, I came from families on both sides that were incredible storytellers. The bar was set high from an early age. I found my passion in theatre class at Madonna High in Mesilla, Park, New Mexico, with teacher/actor Michael Coquat. I fell in love with acting and with him. He cast me in my first play, </span><span class="TextTitle" id="u18384-26">Overtones.</span><span id="u18384-27"> I forgot my first line on stage and had to improvise. Since then, I‚Äôve loved the theatre and improvisation!</span></p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u18384-29">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u18384-41">Theatre was and is my life. I refer to myself as a ‚Äúperformance writer.‚Äù At my first major reading, I read ‚Äúin my style‚Äù and when I got off stage, <span class="TextAuthor">Rudolfo Anaya,</span> author of <span class="TextTitle">Bless Me Ultima,</span> asked me what I‚Äôd done. It didn‚Äôt seem unusual; really, I was just, acting my lines. Who better than me? If I want to change my lines I can at any time. I always ask people not to read along when I am reading a section of something I‚Äôve written. I‚Äôm likely to change something. There is danger in this, though. It‚Äôs sometimes hard to go back. Every writer should try memorizing some of their work and performing it. There‚Äôs much to be learned about rhythm, color, authenticity of voice, truth. Learning my own lines for a character who has Alzheimer‚Äôs in a play I wrote called <span class="TextTitle">Novena Narrativa,</span> was incredibly hard. Much like memorizing <span class="TextAuthor">Beckett</span> or <span class="TextAuthor">Ionesco,</span> which I have done as well. It‚Äôs a good exercise in which one has to find the logic or movement in the illogical.</p>

      <p class="Review-Text" id="u18384-67">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u18384-69">At one point, in my mid- to late twenties, I was writing mostly plays. I could have gone on to become a full-time playwright. And while I consider myself an actor, the thought of a lifetime of rehearsal in darkened theatres was a hard thing to ponder. Also, I knew I had to move to New York or Los Angeles if I was to become a serious actor. I didn‚Äôt want to do that. I remember a playwright in Albuquerque who asked me, ‚ÄúWhy do you always write about New Mexico?‚Äù He could as easily have asked me, ‚ÄúWhy do you always write about Texas?‚Äù I write about my world, the world I know, love and am grounded in. I couldn‚Äôt write about New York and I knew it.</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u18384-70">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u18384-76">I still have plays in me, as I have poems and stories. For now, and at this time, I do go back and forth between genres. But for some reason, there is nothing quite so satisfying in the long run as a ‚Äúlong run.‚Äù I love novels and the heft and thickness of a good long story. Read <span class="TextAuthor">Dostoyevsky</span> or <span class="TextAuthor">Thomas Mann</span> and revel in greatness.</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u18384-77">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u18384-87">I haven‚Äôt really left my acting behind. It is with me daily and I thank all my mentors and teachers who taught me the craft. I studied playwriting at the University of Houston with Edward Albee, have been mentored and studied with <span class="TextAuthor">Megan Terry, Jos√© Quintero, Takis Muzenidis</span> (a director from Greece), <span class="TextAuthor">Leo Lavandero</span> (a Puerto Rican director) <span class="TextAuthor">Hershel Zohn</span> (a Russian director) and many others, including the great American director <span class="TextAuthor">Paul Baker</span>, who was a genius.

      <p class="Review-Text" id="u18384-91">What was your first break as a writer? How did it change your life? Who helped you along the way?</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u18384-92">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u18384-94">I've had so many breaks they are legion. I was lucky to go to an all girls‚Äô Catholic school, Madonna High School. There were twelve of us in our graduating class and we called ourselves ‚ÄúThe Apostelletes.‚Äù I was writing plays as a freshman in high school. Not knowing how to write a play, I wrote them. No one ever held me back. During Holy Week, I read the Passion at Mass (a good acting gig) and was often called upon to recite. The skinniest girl in the class (me)‚Äîplayed Santa Claus for the Christmas play. All seemed possible in writing and art.</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u18384-95">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u18384-97">My mother was always encouraging even though she once said ‚ÄúWhat, another rehearsal?‚Äù She used to pick me up at one or two in the morning from the university theatre when Mr. Zohn kept us long as we should have called it quits. Mother also gave me my first thesaurus at age ten. I still use it and treasure it. My mother, Delfina Rede Faver Ch√°vez, was a cultured woman and would take my sisters and [me] to art movies, to the symphony, and to art exhibits. She loved music, theatre, life. She was my first and will always be my best fan.</p>

I have been saved by blessing more than a few times. And my tale is still about the early days of my work! My life is one of miracle and it has only gotten more miraculous.

      <p class="Review-Text" id="u18384-104">I have read that at age twenty-four, when things were coalescing for you as a writer, you went outside and declared to the universe that you were a writer, and later that you had your creative writing students do the same thing as a part of their process. Why is the ritual important?</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u18384-105">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u18384-111">This story is true. I knew I had to place my prayer at the deepest core of belief and at a place of spirit. I wrote my first story at age eight. I knew I wanted to be a writer at age ten. When I was in my early twenties, I just didn‚Äôt know how I was going to work it. I knew I had to ‚Äúpostulate provision.‚Äù And that meant putting myself in alignment, or better said, ‚Äúon the river of possibility.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know how I was going to make a living, still don‚Äôt. . .but I had to be ready to act when the opportunity for action came along. This Declaration to the Universe is crucial to all of us. So, the young woman that I was, laying on the roof of our home, declared herself, to a life of work and service. I had a <span id="u18384-107">don</span> ‚Äî a gift, and my <span id="u18384-109">manda</span> ‚Äî my promise ‚Äî was to serve the word, my art, my craft, my deepest being. Doing this allowed me to never falter and to keep hope in nearly hopeless times. This is another book!</p>

      <p class="Review-Text" id="u18384-116">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Review-Text" id="u18384-122">I had a great opportunity to be published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux, and by other New York houses. I was young and the publishing industry is always looking for ‚Äúshooting stars‚Äù ‚Äî for young writers to make the wild literary arc and become great and instant successes. <span class="TextAuthor">Sandra Cisneros</span> was a huge success, and many other Latino writers found their work being appreciated and valued. Now we have fewer Latino or multicultural writers getting published. Read <span id="u18384-120">Poets &amp; Writers</span> magazine and see the dearth of writers giving workshops in Poland or even San Miguel de Allende. It‚Äôs the same names over and over. What‚Äôs wrong with this picture? I once wrote an essay called ‚ÄúMove over, Gerald Stern.‚Äù I have met Gerald Stern and love and appreciate him, so it‚Äôs not a personal thing. But it‚Äôs time for varied and multicultural writers to find favor with New York or other publishing houses, for their voices to be heard. Nowadays, alas, it‚Äôs a matter of sales figures. What‚Äôs the answer? For readers to read all sorts of books, to request those books in their bookstores, to get away from the corporatization of literature and to challenge the business of writing.</p>

I write fast and hard and worked on a novel last November for the National Novel Writing Month online program. I didn‚Äôt finish my novel called &quot;The Ghost of Esequiel Hern√°ndez,&quot; but I got deeply into it. The book is set in the Big Bend and has as a background the killing of the Redford, Texas, goat herder, eighteen-year-old Esequiel Hern√°ndez, who was mistaken by U.S. Marines as a drug runner.
